#### -- Project Status: Active

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to extract the number of customer types, i.e., customer segmentation by using the KMeans and Affinity Propagation algorithms(unsupervised ML) to cluster the data. 


### Methods Used
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling
* etc.

### Technologies
* Python
* Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.
* Jupyter Notebook

## Project Description
This dataset comes from a supermarket mall and has membership cards, this data have some basic data about your customers like Customer ID, age, gender, annual income and spending score.
*Spending Score is something you assign to the customer based on your defined parameters like customer behavior and purchasing data.*

There are many models for clustering out there. We will be going through most popular ones. Despite its simplicity, the K-means is vastly used for clustering in many data science applications, especially useful if you need to quickly discover insights from unlabeled data. In this notebook, we see how to use k-Means for customer segmentation.

## Needs of this project

- Data exploration/descriptive statistics
- Data processing/cleaning
- Machine learning modeling
